\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The measurement of \cPZ$/\cPgg^*$  (henceforth denoted by ``\cPZ'') or \Wpm production in association with b-quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is relevant for various experimental searches. In particular, these processes constitute a background to standard model (SM) Higgs production associated with a  \cPZ~or a \Wpm boson, where the Higgs boson decays into a $b\bar{b}$ pair. The discovery by the ATLAS and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiments
of a neutral boson with a mass of about $125\GeV$~\cite{Aad20121,:2012gu} motivates further studies to establish its nature and determine the coupling of the new boson to b quarks. Furthermore, different models based on an extension (minimal or not) of the Higgs sector are being tested against the LHC data through final states composed of lepton(s) and b-jet(s).  In this context, a better understanding of the B-hadrons and/or associated jets dynamics, as well as of the vector boson is therefore required to refine the background prediction for these searches. 

In addition, the study of angular correlation for collinear production of b-quarks, where large theoretical uncertainties remain [ref?] provides a strong lever arm on predictions from theory. Tree-level calculations allowing for large numbers of extra partons in the matrix elements (as initial- and final-state radiation) are available. These are provided by \MADGRAPH~\cite{Alwall:2007st,Alwall:2011uj}, {\ALPGEN~\cite{alpgen},  and \SHERPA~\cite{Gleisberg:2008ta},
in both the five- and  four-flavour approaches, \ie by considering the five or four lightest quark flavours in the proton parton distribution function (PDF) sets. Next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations have been performed in both the five-flavour (\MCFM)~\cite{Campbell:2000bg} and four-flavour~\cite{FebresCordero:2008ci,Cordero:2009kv}  approaches. A fully automated NLO computation matched to a parton shower simulation is implemented by the a\MCATNLO event
generator~\cite{Frederix:2011qg,Frixione:2002ik}. A detailed discussion of b-quark production in the different calculation schemes is available in Ref.~\cite{Maltoni:2012pa}.


From the experimental point of view, the study of b-flavoured final states is possible through two complementary techniques. First using the standard jet-based b-tagging methods~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012jua}. These techniques are dominantly considered in searches sensitive to emission of b-jets. Second via the complementary approach that identifies the b-hadrons from displaced secondary vertices, which are reconstructed from their charged decay products. This approach is implemented in the inclusive secondary vertex  finder (IVF)~\cite{Khachatryan:2011wq}. The IVF exploits
the excellent tracking capabilities of the CMS detector and, being independent of the jet reconstruction, extends the sensitivity to small angular separations and softer b-hadron transverse momenta ($\pt$).
  
This article presents several studies. First, a precise measurement, not statistically limited of the unbinned production cross-section for \cPZ+1 and 2 b-jets,  \Wpm+2 b-jets is given. This is particularly important for the comparison with the normalization prediction provided at NLO.  

Second, the differential production cross-section of several variables: $\pt^{\rm V}$, V=\cPZ, \Wpm, $\pt^{\cPqb_i}$ and $\eta^{\cPqb_i}$, $i$ denoting the list of b-jets sorted by transverse momentum, the mass of b-jet system $m^{\cPqb_1,\cPqb_2}$. These variables are considered in searches for new physics states through channels implying b-jets, and a comparison between the data and predictions from theory is therefore crucial to understand how well the predicted shapes match the reality. 

Third, the production cross-section of the processes where the 2 b-hadrons are found in one single jet is provided, as well as the angular correlation between the two b-hadrons $\Delta R_{\mathrm{BB}}$ and $\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{BB}}$, The variable $\Delta R_{\mathrm{BB}}$ is defined as $\Delta R_{\mathrm{BB}} = \sqrt{ (\Delta \phi_{\mathrm{BB}})^2 + (\Delta \eta_{\mathrm{BB}})^2}$, where $\Delta \phi_{\mathrm{BB}}$ and $\Delta \eta_{\mathrm{BB}}$ are the azimuthal (in radians) and pseudorapidity separations. The pseudorapidity is defined as $\eta= -\ln[\tan(\theta/2)]$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle  relative to the anticlockwise beam direction. determined from the separation between the flight directions of the two particles in $(\eta,\phi)$ and in the transverse plane, respectively.  Besides helping to understand the contamination of V+2 b-hadrons inside one jet to V+1 b-hadron in one jet, The $\Delta R_{\mathrm{BB}}$
distribution constitutes a direct test of the modeling of the different $\mathrm{pp}\rightarrow {\rm V} \bbbar\mathrm{X}$ production modes. This quantity allows the identification of the contribution from the $\cPq{i} \rightarrow {\rm V} \bbbar \mathrm{X}$ subprocesses (where $i=\cPq$, $\cPg$) for which the scattering amplitude modelling is based on Feynman diagrams with a final $\cPg \rightarrow \bbbar$ splitting. In particular, at leading order, and assuming no cut on the transverse momentum of the vector boson, this type of subprocess is dominant over the whole  $\Delta R_{\mathrm{BB}}$ range for $\Wpm b\overline{b}$ while it is true only for small $\Delta R_{\mathrm{BB}}$ for $\cPZ b\overline{b}$ process. This is due to the dominant subprocesses with two initial-state gluon splittings or where the \cPZ is radiated off a final state b-quark line. In these cases, the angular correlation between the b-quarks is much weaker. leading order diagram for both $\cPq\cPq\rightarrow \cPZ b\overline{b}$ and  $\cPq\cPq\rightarrow \Wpm b\overline{b}$ is shown in Figs.~\ref{diag} (a), together with diagrams representative of other $\mathrm{pp}\rightarrow\cPZ\bbbar$ production modes: emission of a \cPZ~boson from a b-quark
line (b), and b-quark fusion $\cPg\cPg \rightarrow \cPZ\bbbar$ (c).

For each measurement, the observed results are compared to several theoretical predictions.


The sections are organized as follows: the description of the CMS experiment and simulated samples are given in
Section~\ref{sec:cms}; the event reconstruction and selection are presented in Section~\ref{sec:eventrecoandselection}. The discussion on the inclusive and differential cross-section measurements (based on b-jets) are found inSection~\ref{sec:bjetinclusivexsec} and the Section~\ref{sec:bjetdifferentialxsec}. 
The measurement of the cross-section corresponding to the collinear production of b-hadrons and  the discussion on angular correlation between the b-hadrons is detailed in ~\ref{sec:collxsec}. The conclusions is presented in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.
