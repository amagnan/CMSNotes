\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Three alternatives have been proposed to replace the endcap
calorimetry for the LHC upgrade towards high luminosity (2023 in the
current timeline). In particular, a proposal of using a highly
granular sampling calorimeter, using Si as sensitive material and
probably lead as absorber, is being studied. This note concentrates on
the electromagnetic part of such a design.

In section~\ref{sec:setup}, the geometry of the baseline design is
detailed, as implemented in a standalone Geant4~\cite{Agostinelli2003250}
simulation, and within CMSSW. The impact on the energy resolution of
using different silicon thicknesses, absorber materials, and sampling
thicknesses is studied in section~\ref{sec:optim}. The digitisation
procedure is explained in section~\ref{sec:digi}. More detailed
studies of the performances, in ideal conditions and with pileup, are
shown in section~\ref{sec:perf}.
